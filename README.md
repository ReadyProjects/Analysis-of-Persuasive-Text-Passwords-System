Title: Analysis of Persuasive Text Passwords System using PHP and MySQL

Abstract:

In the contemporary landscape of cybersecurity, the importance of robust password systems cannot be overstated. This research focuses on the development and analysis of a Persuasive Text Passwords System (PTPS) implemented through PHP and MySQL. The objective is to enhance password security by leveraging persuasive and memorable textual elements in the password creation process.

The proposed system employs PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for database management, creating a dynamic and efficient platform for user authentication. The PTPS introduces a novel approach to password creation by incorporating persuasive text elements, aiming to enhance both security and user experience. Instead of relying solely on complex alphanumeric combinations, the system prompts users to create passwords using memorable phrases or sentences that are difficult for attackers to guess yet easy for users to recall.

This research includes the design and implementation of the PTPS, examining its integration with PHP and MySQL to ensure seamless functionality. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to evaluate the system's effectiveness in enhancing password security compared to traditional methods. Metrics such as password strength, user satisfaction, and resistance to common attacks are considered in the assessment.

The findings of this research contribute valuable insights into the feasibility and practicality of adopting persuasive text elements in password systems. The implications of the PTPS on user behavior, system performance, and overall security are discussed, providing a foundation for future research in the field of cybersecurity. The research aims to bridge the gap between strong security measures and user-friendly experiences in password management, fostering a more resilient and accessible approach to safeguarding digital assets.
